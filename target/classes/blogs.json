        "description": "<p>Java is a popular, versatile, and widely-used programming language that was first released by Sun Microsystems in 1995.

Object-Oriented: </strong></h3><p>Java is an object-oriented programming (OOP) language, which means it focuses on creating objects that encapsulate data and behavior. This approach promotes modularity, reusability, and maintainability of code.</p><p><br></p><h3><strong>2. Platform Independence: </strong></h3><p>Java achieves platform independence through the 'Write Once, Run Anywhere' principle. Developers can write Java code on one platform and run it on any platform with a compatible JVM.</p><p><br></p><h3><strong>3. Strongly Typed: Java is a statically typed language, </strong></h3><p>which means that variable types must be explicitly declared and checked at compile-time. This helps catch type-related errors early in the development process.</p><p><br></p><h3><strong>4. Garbage Collection: </strong></h3><p>Java includes automatic memory management through a process called garbage collection. This feature helps manage memory by reclaiming unused objects, reducing the risk of memory leaks.</p><p><br></p><h3><strong>5.

Multithreading: </strong></h3><p>Java supports multithreading, allowing developers to create concurrent and parallel programs easily.
